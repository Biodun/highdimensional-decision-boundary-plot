Plotting high-dimensional decision boundaries
===============

An experimental, scikit-learn compatible approach to **plot high-dimensional decision boundaries**. This facilitates **intuitive understanding**, and helps improve models by allowing the visual inspection of misclassified regions, model complexity, and the amount of overfitting/underfitting. Unlike training/test error curves and ROC curves, this approach also visually indicates the contribution of individual instances to the result, allowing further investigation.
